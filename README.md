### Tutorial

To start off you need to download Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads. Complete the set up and connect it to your code-editor of choice. Next set up a GitHub account. Go to https://github.com/join and sign up. You can now create your first repository. The last step is to make sure Git and GitHub are linked with your code-editor. Some editors, such as Visual Studio Code, have Git and GitHub functionality built in.
